// Define functions that map:
//   f2c_cdotu_() -> cdotu_()
//   f2c_cdotc_() -> cdotc_()
//   f2c_zdotu_() -> zdotu_()
//   f2c_zdotc_() -> zdotc_()
//
// When certain code (e.g. LAPACK) is converted to C with f2c, calls to complex
// dot product "return" the dot product value in a "hidden" argument that f2c
// inserts before all others. These functions adhere to that same calling
// convention, but then immediately call the equivalent BLAS function using
// normal return value semantics. (Using these wrappers is easier than fixing
// the code emitted by f2c.)
//
// NOTE: The blis_conjx and blisname macro arguments are unused here.
